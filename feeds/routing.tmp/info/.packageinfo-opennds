Description:   openNDS (open Network Demarcation Service) is a high performance, small footprint, Captive Portal.
  It provides a border control gateway between a public local area network and the Internet.
  It supports all scenarios ranging from small stand alone venues through to large mesh networks with multiple portal entry points.
  Both the client driven Captive Portal Detection method (CPD) and gateway driven Captive Portal Identification method (CPI - RFC 8910 and RFC 8908) are supported.
  This version requires iptables-nft.
